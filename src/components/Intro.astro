      <p>Welcome to my personal blog, where I focus on sharing my knowledge and experiences using open source technologies, platform and network engineering.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I created this blog to document my journey as a system engineer, with a focus on leveraging cutting-edge technologies to build scalable, reliable and secure systems. 
        Here you will find a variety of content, including tutorials, tips, and personal reflections on my journey as a cloud engineer.</p>
      <br>
      To get my feet wet with modern web development, I built this blog using <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>, <a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://github.com/svengerber/personal_website">open sourced</a> it.
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Thank you for visiting my blog, and I hope you find the content here informative and helpful.</p>
      <p>Happy engineering! üõ†Ô∏è</p>
