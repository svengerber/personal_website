          <br>
          <p>I created this blog to document my journey as a system engineer, with a focus on leveraging cutting-edge technologies to build scalable, reliable and secure systems. 
            Here you will find a variety of content, including tutorials, tips, and personal reflections on my journey as a system engineer.</p>
          <br>
          To get my feet wet with modern web development, I built this blog using <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>, <a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://github.com/svengerber/personal_website">open sourced</a> it.
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Thank you for visiting my blog, and I hope you find the content here informative and helpful. Happy engineering! üõ†Ô∏è</p>
